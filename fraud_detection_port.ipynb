        "\n",
        "**Background:** A new credit card company has just entered the market in the western United States. The company is promoting itself as one of the safest credit cards to use. They have hired you as their data scientist in charge of identifying instances of fraud. The executive who hired you has have provided you with data on credit card transactions, including whether or not each transaction was fraudulent.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Objective:** The executive wants to know how accurately you can predict fraud using this data. She has stressed that the model should err on the side of caution: it is not a big problem to flag transactions as fraudulent when they aren't just to be safe. In your report, you will need to describe how well your model functions and how it adheres to these criteria.\n",
        "\n",
        "You will need to prepare a report that is accessible to a broad audience. It will need to outline your motivation, analysis steps, findings, and conclusions."
